# This code is acting like a client â€” just like a browser, mobile app, or frontend 
# â€” sending a request to your FastAPI server and reading the response.

# Itâ€™s useful for:

#     âœ… Testing your API without using Swagger UI (/docs)

#     âœ… Automating requests (e.g., for scripts, bots, or monitoring)

#     âœ… Simulating real-world usage from another system

#     âœ… Debugging how your server responds to different inputs


# ðŸ§© Why open a separate terminal?

# Because:

#     Your FastAPI server is already running in one terminal (via uvicorn)

#     You need a second process to act as the client

# Itâ€™s like having one window for the restaurant kitchen (server) 
# and another for the customer placing an order (client).
